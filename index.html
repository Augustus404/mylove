            I once forgot to update this website,  
            but I never forgot <span>you</span>.

        <h2>A Promise I Still Keep</h2>
        <p>
            This website is proof that my love never disappeared.  
            Time passed, life happened, mistakes were made —  
            but my heart never moved away from you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like this page, my love may pause,  
            but it never ends.
